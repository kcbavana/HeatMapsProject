I have used three different heat maps.

The first one is Sex offence. The biggest reason for chosing sex offence because it is very around the world and many people die due to sexual crimes, so I thought it would be
best to graph this. I have just chosen basic graph with five ranges because I want to know the wide range of this crime.

The second one is Theft graph. The reason for chosing theft was it is very common. I have chosen 10 ranges for this because I wanted to know better understanding of the range
in different places. It would also be really good to compare it with literacy, if I had that data, it would be nice to see the predictions of how can it effect the future

The third graph is Criminal Tresspass. I chose it because it very rare in many parts of thr world. I chose 15 ranges because I want to know how range differs from location because
due its less crime rate. Also I chose different colors because I wanted to show the difference from others.
